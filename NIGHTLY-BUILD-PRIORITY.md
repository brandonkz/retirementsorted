### HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. Joint Budget Calculator (Couples)
**Problem:** Couples struggle to figure out fair contribution to shared expenses

**Target:** Married/cohabiting couples with different incomes

**Inputs:**

- Shared expenses (detailed):
  - Rent/bond
  - Utilities

  - Medical aid
  - School fees
  - Car payments
  - Insurance
  - Entertainment

**Calculation Methods:**
1. **Proportional** (based on income % - fair)
   - Earns 60% of household income → pays 60% of expenses
2. **50/50 Split** (equal regardless of income)

```
Total Joint Expenses: R85,000/month
