      <h1>Cape Town's Airbnb Tax Increase: What Property Owners Actually Need to Know</h1>
      
      <p class="lead">If you own an Airbnb in Cape Town, you're about to see your municipal rates bill more than double. Here's what's actually happening and what it means for your property.</p>
      
      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <strong>The Short Version:</strong> Cape Town wants to reclassify short-term rental properties from residential to commercial rates. That's a 135% increase in municipal rates for most owners. A R2 million property currently paying R14,572/year would jump to R40,280/year - an extra R25,708 annually.
      </div>
      
      <h2>What's Actually Changing</h2>
      
      <p>Right now, most Airbnb properties in Cape Town are classified as residential. They pay the standard 0.86 cents per rand rate (with a R300,000 rebate). That's been the case even if the property operates full-time as a rental.</p>
      
      <p>Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis and the City want to change that. Their view is simple: if your property operates like a hotel, it should be taxed like one.</p>
      
      <p>Under the proposed policy, properties used primarily for short-term letting would be reclassified as commercial. Same category as hotels, guesthouses, and B&Bs. And commercial properties pay about 2.35 times the residential rate - around 2.0 cents per rand with no rebate.</p>
      
      <h2>The Real Numbers</h2>
      
      <p>Let's look at what this actually costs. I'll use a R2 million property because that's roughly the entry point for a decent Airbnb in areas like Observatory, Woodstock, or even parts of Sea Point.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Current residential rate:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Formula: (R2,000,000 - R300,000) × 0.008572</li>
        <li>Annual rates: <strong>R14,572</strong></li>
        <li>Monthly: R1,214</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Proposed commercial rate:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Formula: R2,000,000 × 0.02014</li>
        <li>Annual rates: <strong>R40,280</strong></li>
        <li>Monthly: R3,357</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Increase: R25,708 per year</strong></p>
      
      <p>That's R2,142 extra every month. For a property earning maybe R20-25k/month in rental income, that's a 9-11% hit to your gross revenue before you've paid for cleaning, maintenance, or anything else.</p>
      
      <p>And if you own something in Camps Bay or Bantry Bay valued at R5-10 million? You're looking at R60-120k extra per year. That's a substantial chunk of your profit margin.</p>

      </div>
      
      <h2>Who's Actually Affected</h2>
      
      <p>This isn't a niche issue. Cape Town has over 25,000 active Airbnb listings - more than New York or Amsterdam. The City's targeting properties that operate as <em>primary</em> short-term rentals. If you're renting your place out 200+ days a year on Airbnb or Booking.com, you're probably in scope.</p>
      
      <p>What they haven't clarified yet (because the policy's still under consultation) is where exactly the line sits. Is it 100 days a year? 180? Full-time only? Nobody knows yet.</p>
      
      <p>But if you're running what is effectively a small hotel out of your property - listing it year-round, professional management, cleaners coming and going - yeah, you're likely getting reclassified.</p>
      
      <h2>Why the City's Doing This</h2>
      
      <p>Hill-Lewis has been pretty open about the reasoning. There are two arguments:</p>
      
      <p><strong>1. Tax fairness.</strong> Hotels and guesthouses pay commercial rates. Airbnbs compete with them for the same tourist Rands but pay way less in rates. From the City's perspective, that's a subsidy for short-term rentals at the expense of traditional hospitality businesses. They want parity.</p>
      
      <p><strong>2. Housing pressure.</strong> Cape Town's rental market is brutal right now. Long-term rentals are expensive and scarce. Meanwhile, thousands of properties sit on Airbnb earning tourism income instead of housing locals.</p>
      
      <p>The hope (or the pitch, depending how cynical you are) is that higher commercial rates will push some owners to reconsider. Maybe they convert back to long-term rentals, easing pressure on the rental market.</p>
      
      <p>Whether that actually happens is anyone's guess. If your Airbnb's pulling R30k/month and long-term rent in the same area is R18k, you're probably eating the extra R2k in rates and staying on Airbnb. But marginal properties - the ones earning R15-20k in slower areas - might not survive the hit.</p>
      
      <h2>What Happens if You Just Ignore It</h2>
      
      <p>Short answer: you can't really.</p>
      
      <p>If the policy passes, the City will reclassify properties based on their records and probably data from Airbnb/Booking.com (they've been pretty aggressive about getting platform data). You'll get a notice that your property's been reclassified, and your rates bill will go up.</p>
      
      <p>You can appeal, but you'd need to prove your property isn't primarily used for short-term letting. If you're listed 300 days a year with 200+ bookings, that's gonna be tough.</p>
      
      <h2>Your Options (Realistically)</h2>
      
      <p><strong>1. Keep it as an Airbnb and pay the higher rates</strong></p>
      
      <p>If your occupancy and nightly rates are strong, you might just absorb the cost. Run the numbers - if you're clearing R10-15k profit per month <em>after</em> the extra R2-3k in rates, maybe it's still worth it.</p>
      
      <p>Especially if you think Cape Town tourism will keep growing (which it probably will - the city's a magnet for remote workers and international tourists).</p>
      
      <p><strong>2. Switch to long-term rental</strong></p>
      
      <p>Convert your Airbnb into a traditional lease. Keep your residential rates, lose the Airbnb income, gain stability and way less admin.</p>
      
      <p>The math might work if long-term rent in your area is close to what you'd net from Airbnb after accounting for higher rates, vacancies, cleaning, platform fees, and your time.</p>
      
      <p>Plus, long-term tenants mean predictable monthly income and no guest drama at 2am.</p>
      
      <p><strong>3. Hybrid approach (risky)</strong></p>
      
      <p>Some owners might try to game the system - rent long-term for 7-8 months, do short-term during peak summer season. Technically you're not <em>primarily</em> a short-term rental.</p>
      
      <p>Will the City buy that? Hard to say. They haven't defined "primarily" yet. And if they do quarterly reviews or spot checks, you might still get flagged.</p>
      
      <p><strong>4. Sell the property</strong></p>
      
      <p>If the returns don't justify the hassle anymore, exit. Cape Town property's been strong the past few years, so you'd probably still make decent money on the sale (assuming you bought before prices went nuts).</p>
      
      <p>But if you're sitting on a place you bought in 2020-21 when prices dipped during COVID, selling now after taking the capital gains might actually leave you worse off than just riding it out.</p>
      
      <h2>Timeline and What's Next</h2>
      
      <p>As of mid-February 2026, this is still a <em>proposal</em>. It's not law yet. The City's in consultation mode, which means public hearings, submissions from property owners and industry groups, probably some legal challenges.</p>
      
      <p>Implementation timeline is unclear, but given how vocal Hill-Lewis has been about this, I'd expect movement within the next 6-12 months. The City's budget cycle runs July to June, so changes could come in the 2026/27 or 2027/28 budget.</p>
      
      <p>If you own an Airbnb in Cape Town, here's what I'd do:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Calculate your exposure.</strong> Use our <a href="/airbnb-tax-calculator.html">calculator</a> or run the numbers yourself. Know what the extra cost would be.</li>
        <li><strong>Model your scenarios.</strong> What do your returns look like if rates go up 135%? What if you went long-term instead? Which makes more financial sense?</li>
        <li><strong>Watch for updates.</strong> The City will announce implementation details eventually. Sign up for updates from your property management company or local ratepayer association.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider your timeline.</strong> If you were planning to sell in the next 2-3 years anyway, maybe accelerate that before the reclassification hits and potentially affects your buyer pool.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
      
      <p>This isn't just about rates. It's part of a broader tension in Cape Town (and honestly, most desirable cities globally) between tourism income and housing availability for locals.</p>
      
      <p>Airbnb's been great for property owners. You can earn 50-100% more than traditional rent if you manage it well. But it's also pulled thousands of units out of the long-term market, driving up rents for people who actually live and work here.</p>
      
      <p>Is a 135% rates increase the right policy response? Debatable. It definitely hits smaller operators harder than big players with multiple properties who can absorb the cost. And it's not clear it'll actually bring much housing back to the long-term market - if the returns still favor Airbnb even with higher rates, most owners will just pay up.</p>
      
      <p>But from the City's perspective, they see a situation where short-term rentals get a tax advantage while contributing to a housing crisis. The politics of that are tough to defend, especially in an election year.</p>
      
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      
      <p>Look, if you own a short-term rental in Cape Town, this probably sucks to read. An extra R2-3k per month in rates is a real hit, especially if your margins were already tight.</p>
      
      <p>But it's not the end of the world either. The city's tourism market is strong. Demand for short-term accommodation isn't going away. If your property's in a good location and you're managing it well, you'll probably weather this.</p>
      
      <p>The key is running the numbers now - before the policy's finalized - so you know what you're working with. Maybe you keep going as-is. Maybe you pivot to long-term. Maybe you sell. But make that decision based on actual math, not just hoping the policy goes away.</p>
      
      <p>Because based on how strongly Hill-Lewis is pushing this, I'd bet on some version of it happening.</p>
