    <h1>I Withdrew From My Two-Pot Retirement - Here's What Actually Happened</h1>
    <div class="blog-meta">
      By @brandonkz • February 12, 2026 • 6 min read

    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>So I did it. After months of hearing everyone talk about two-pot withdrawals, I finally pulled R15,000 from my retirement savings.</p>

      <p>Was it worth it? Did SARS take half like everyone said they would? How long did it actually take?</p>

      <p>Here's exactly what happened. No theory, no generic advice - just the real timeline and numbers.</p>

      <h2>Why I Withdrew</h2>

      <p>Look, I'm not proud of this. But I had a car repair bill that I couldn't ignore. R12,000 for a new gearbox. My emergency fund was already tapped out from load shedding (had to replace the fridge after one too many power cuts).</p>

      <p>I could've put it on a credit card at 21% interest. Or I could take R15k from my retirement and pay about 25% tax on it. The math was pretty clear.</p>

      <p>Still felt like shit pressing that button though.</p>

      <h2>The Application Process</h2>

      <p>I'm with Old Mutual. Logged into my account, clicked on the savings pot section. There was a big green button that said "Request Withdrawal" - they're not exactly making it hard.</p>

      <p>Had to fill in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How much I wanted (capped at R16,400 for me - 10% of my savings pot)</li>
        <li>Banking details (already had mine on file)</li>
        <li>Confirm I understood the tax implications</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Whole thing took maybe 5 minutes. Then the waiting started.</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Screenshot everything. Confirmation numbers, dates, amounts. Some funds are slower than others and you'll want proof if something goes wrong.
      </div>

      <h2>The Timeline</h2>

      <p><strong>Day 1 (Monday):</strong> Submitted the request at 10am. Got an automated email saying "we received your application."</p>

      <p><strong>Day 3 (Wednesday):</strong> Nothing. Started getting nervous. Checked the portal - status said "processing."</p>

      <p><strong>Day 5 (Friday):</strong> Email at 2pm. "Your withdrawal has been approved." Amount after tax: R11,250.</p>

      <p><strong>Day 7 (Monday):</strong> Money hit my account. 7 business days total.</p>

      <p>Not instant like some people claimed, but not the "4-6 weeks" horror stories either.</p>

      <h2>The Tax Hit</h2>

      <p>Here's where it hurt. I earn about R45k per month (R540k per year). That puts me in the 31% tax bracket according to SARS.</p>

      <p>But here's what actually happened:</p>

      <p><strong>Withdrawal request:</strong> R15,000<br>
      <strong>Tax deducted:</strong> R3,750 (25%)<br>
      <strong>Actual payout:</strong> R11,250</p>

      <p>Wait, 25%? Not 31%?</p>

      <p>Turns out they calculate it differently. It's not just your marginal rate - they look at your total annual income plus the withdrawal. Then they figure out the effective tax rate on that specific chunk.</p>

      <p>Still painful, but not as bad as I expected.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Your tax rate will be different. If you earn more than me, you'll pay more. If you earn less, you'll pay less. Use the <a href="../#calculator" style="color: var(--color-primary); font-weight: 600;">calculator</a> before you withdraw - don't just guess.
      </div>

      <h2>What I Lost Long-Term</h2>

      <p>This is the part that keeps me up at night.</p>

      <p>That R15,000 today? If I'd left it invested until I'm 65 (I'm 38 now), it would've grown to about R140,000 at a conservative 8% annual return.</p>

      <p>So I basically traded R140k in retirement money for R11k cash today. Plus a working car, sure. But still.</p>

      <p>That's the real cost nobody talks about. Not the 25% tax. The 27 years of compound interest I just flushed.</p>

      <h2>Would I Do It Again?</h2>

      <p>Honestly? Probably not.</p>

      <p>If I could go back, I would've:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sold some stuff first (had a PlayStation I never used)</li>
        <li>Asked family for a short-term loan</li>
        <li>Looked harder at 0% credit card offers</li>
        <li>Maybe even negotiated a payment plan with the mechanic</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The two-pot withdrawal felt easy because it was easy. That's the problem. No credit checks, no applications, no awkward conversations. Just click and wait.</p>

      <p>But "easy" cost me R140k in future money.</p>

      <h2>If You're Thinking About It</h2>

      <p>Real talk: only do this if you absolutely have to.</p>

      <p><strong>Good reasons:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Medical emergency</li>
        <li>About to lose your home</li>
        <li>Critical car repair (like me) and you need it for work</li>
        <li>High-interest debt that's drowning you</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Bad reasons:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Holiday</li>
        <li>"I deserve it"</li>
        <li>New TV/phone/whatever</li>
        <li>FOMO because everyone else is doing it</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And whatever you do, use the calculator first. Dont guess. I thought I'd get R12k and was planning around that number. Getting R11,250 wasn't a huge difference, but it could've been if I was counting on every rand.</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Calculate your real payout:</strong> Use the <a href="../#calculator" style="color: var(--color-primary); font-weight: 600;">two-pot calculator</a> to see exactly what you'll get after tax. Takes 30 seconds and could save you from a nasty surprise.
      </div>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>Process was smooth. Money came through in a week. Tax wasn't as brutal as I feared.</p>

      <p>But I still lost R140k in retirement savings. That's the real story.</p>

      <p>If you're in a genuine emergency, the two-pot system is there for you. Just know what you're trading. Not just today's tax bill - tomorrow's retirement income.</p>

      <p>And maybe check if your PlayStation has any resale value first.</p>
